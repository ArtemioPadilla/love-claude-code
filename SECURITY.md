# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability in Love Claude Code, please report it responsibly:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email security concerns to: [security@loveclaudecode.com] (replace with actual email)
3. Include detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for us to address the issue before public disclosure

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Environment Variables and Secrets

#### Never Commit Secrets
- **NEVER** commit `.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.docker`, or any file containing real credentials
- Use `.env.example` files to document required variables without values
- Add all `.env*` files (except `.env.example`) to `.gitignore`

#### Required Secrets
The following environment variables MUST be set with secure values in production:

```bash
# Critical Security Variables
JWT_SECRET                  # Must be a strong, random string (min 32 characters)
POSTGRES_PASSWORD           # Database password
MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD         # Object storage password
GRAFANA_ADMIN_PASSWORD      # Monitoring dashboard password

# API Keys (keep secure)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY           # Claude API key
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID           # AWS credentials
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY       # AWS credentials
FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY # Firebase service account
```

#### Generating Secure Secrets
```bash
# Generate a secure JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32

# Generate a secure password
openssl rand -base64 24

# Generate a UUID
uuidgen
```

### 2. Pre-commit Hooks for Secret Detection

Install and configure secret detection tools:

```bash
# Install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit

# Install detect-secrets
pip install detect-secrets

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << 'EOF'
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets
    rev: v1.4.0
    hooks:
      - id: detect-secrets
        args: ['--baseline', '.secrets.baseline']
  - repo: https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks
    rev: v8.18.0
    hooks:
      - id: gitleaks
EOF

# Initialize detect-secrets
detect-secrets scan > .secrets.baseline

# Install the git hook
pre-commit install
```

### 3. Docker Security

#### Container Security
- Use specific image versions, not `latest`
- Run containers as non-root users
- Limit container capabilities
- Use read-only file systems where possible

#### Docker Compose Security
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    # Good: Uses environment variable
    environment:
      - JWT_SECRET=${JWT_SECRET}
    
    # Bad: Hard-coded secret
    # environment:
    #   - JWT_SECRET=my-secret-key

    # Security options
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp
```

### 4. API Security

#### Authentication
- All API endpoints must validate JWT tokens
- Implement proper session management
- Use secure cookie settings in production:
  ```javascript
  {
    secure: true,      // HTTPS only
    httpOnly: true,    // No JavaScript access
    sameSite: 'strict' // CSRF protection
  }
  ```

#### Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Use progressive delays for failed authentication attempts
- Monitor for suspicious patterns

#### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries for database operations
- Sanitize file uploads and paths
- Implement CSRF protection

### 5. Code Execution Security

#### Sandboxing
- All user code must run in isolated containers
- Enforce resource limits (CPU, memory, time)
- No network access from sandboxed code
- Read-only file systems

#### File Access
- Validate all file paths
- Prevent directory traversal attacks
- Limit file upload sizes and types
- Scan uploaded files for malware

### 6. Database Security

#### Connection Security
- Use SSL/TLS for database connections
- Rotate database credentials regularly
- Use least-privilege database users
- Enable query logging for audit trails

#### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use prepared statements
- Implement row-level security where needed
- Regular security audits

### 7. Infrastructure Security

#### Network Security
- Use HTTPS everywhere (enforce HSTS)
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Enable security headers:
  ```nginx
  add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN";
  add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff";
  add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block";
  add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin";
  ```

#### Monitoring
- Log all authentication attempts
- Monitor for unusual access patterns
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security scans

### 8. Development Practices

#### Code Review
- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Pay special attention to:
  - Authentication/authorization logic
  - Input validation
  - Cryptographic operations
  - File system operations
  - Database queries

#### Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review dependency licenses

#### Security Testing
- Include security tests in CI/CD
- Perform regular penetration testing
- Use static analysis tools
- Test error handling

### 9. Incident Response

#### Preparation
1. Maintain an incident response plan
2. Keep security contact information updated
3. Regular security drills
4. Document all security procedures

#### Response Steps
1. Contain the incident
2. Assess the impact
3. Collect evidence
4. Notify affected users (if required)
5. Fix the vulnerability
6. Document lessons learned

### 10. Compliance

#### Data Protection
- Implement GDPR compliance measures
- Provide data export/deletion capabilities
- Clear privacy policy
- Secure data transmission and storage

#### Audit Trail
- Log all administrative actions
- Maintain audit logs for compliance
- Regular security assessments
- Third-party security audits

## Security Checklist for Contributors

Before submitting a PR, ensure:

- [ ] No secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] All inputs are validated
- [ ] Authentication is properly implemented
- [ ] Errors don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] Dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Security headers are set
- [ ] HTTPS is enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented
- [ ] Logs don't contain sensitive data
- [ ] Tests cover security scenarios

## Common Security Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Hard-coding credentials** - Always use environment variables
2. **Trusting user input** - Always validate and sanitize
3. **Weak passwords** - Enforce strong password policies
4. **Missing authentication** - Protect all sensitive endpoints
5. **Verbose error messages** - Don't expose system details
6. **Outdated dependencies** - Regular updates are crucial
7. **Missing HTTPS** - Always use encrypted connections
8. **Weak session management** - Implement proper timeouts
9. **No rate limiting** - Protect against abuse
10. **Missing security headers** - Use all recommended headers
