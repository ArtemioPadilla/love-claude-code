# Electron API Integration Update

## ✅ Completed: Update All API Calls to Use IPC

### Summary
Successfully updated all frontend API calls to use Electron IPC when running as a desktop app. The app now intelligently detects the Electron environment and routes calls through IPC instead of HTTP.

### Key Changes Implemented

#### 1. **Electron Detection Utility** (`frontend/src/utils/electronDetection.ts`)
- Created comprehensive TypeScript definitions for `window.electronAPI`
- Helper functions: `isElectron()`, `getElectronAPI()`, `getPlatformInfo()`
- Platform detection and Claude CLI availability checks

#### 2. **Electron API Adapter** (`frontend/src/services/electronApiAdapter.ts`)
- Adapter pattern to translate API calls to Electron IPC
- Handles all major endpoints:
  - Authentication (login/logout)
  - Settings (get/save)
  - Projects (CRUD operations)
  - Files (read/write/list)
  - Claude chat (with streaming support)

#### 3. **Updated Main API Service** (`frontend/src/services/api.ts`)
- Added Electron detection to all methods
- Routes to `electronApiAdapter` when in Electron
- Falls back to HTTP for web version
- Examples:
  ```typescript
  async getProjects() {
    if (isElectron()) {
      const result = await electronApiAdapter.getProjects();
      if (result.error) throw new Error(result.error);
      return result.data || [];
    }
    // Original HTTP implementation...
  }
  ```

#### 4. **File API Updates**
- Created `fileApiElectron.ts` for Electron file operations
- Updated `fileApi.ts` to detect and use Electron
- Full file tree support with proper path handling
- Security: Path validation ensures access only within project directories

#### 5. **UI Integration**
- **Chat Component**: Added Claude setup wizard for Electron users
- **Settings Store**: Updated to use new API methods
- **Claude Terminal**: Shows setup instructions when CLI not configured

### Features Now Working in Electron

✅ **Authentication**
- No traditional login required in Electron
- Claude CLI authentication status checking
- OS keychain integration for credentials

✅ **Project Management**
- Create projects with templates (web, node, python)
- List and open projects
- Delete projects with optional file cleanup
- Custom project directory support

✅ **File Operations**
- Read/write files with security checks
- Directory listing and navigation
- File/save dialogs using native OS dialogs
- Path validation to prevent access outside project directories

✅ **Claude Integration**
- CLI status checking
- Command execution with streaming
- Setup wizard for first-time users
- Terminal mode with full CLI support

✅ **Settings**
- Load/save settings locally in Electron
- Preferences stored using electron-store
- No server round-trip required

### Architecture Benefits

1. **Offline First**: All operations work without internet (except Claude API calls)
2. **Security**: Context isolation, path validation, secure IPC
3. **Performance**: No HTTP overhead, direct file system access
4. **Native Feel**: OS dialogs, keychain integration, native menus

### Testing the Integration

To test the Electron app with API integration:

```bash
# Start the Electron app
npm run electron:dev

# The app will:
# 1. Detect it's running in Electron
# 2. Route all API calls through IPC
# 3. Use local file system and electron-store
# 4. Show Claude setup wizard if needed
```

### Next Steps

The remaining high-priority task is:
- **Remove server dependencies** - Currently in progress. Need to ensure the Electron app can run completely standalone without any backend server.

### Code Quality

- ✅ TypeScript definitions for all IPC channels
- ✅ Error handling with graceful fallbacks
- ✅ Security checks on all file operations
- ✅ Consistent API interface between web and Electron

This completes the major task of updating all API calls to use IPC, bringing us closer to a fully functional standalone Electron app for Claude Max users!
