# CI/CD Integration Guide: Constructs in Your Pipeline

## Overview

Love Claude Code transforms CI/CD from configuration hell to natural language workflows. This guide shows how to integrate construct-based development into your existing CI/CD pipelines and create self-deploying applications.

---

## The Paradigm Shift

### Traditional CI/CD
```yaml
# 200+ lines of YAML configuration
# Multiple tools and services
# Fragile interdependencies
# Manual updates for new features
```

### Love Claude Code CI/CD
```
User: "Create a CI/CD pipeline that builds, tests, and deploys 
constructs with security scanning and rollback capability"

Claude: "I'll create a complete CI/CD construct pattern..."
```

## Integration Strategies

### 1. GitHub Actions Integration

#### Basic Construct Pipeline
```yaml
name: Construct CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]
  pull_request:

jobs:
  construct-validation:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Setup Love Claude Code
        uses: love-claude-code/setup-action@v1
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
      
      - name: Validate Constructs
        run: |
          lcc validate --all-constructs
          lcc test --coverage-threshold 95
      
      - name: Security Scan
        run: lcc security-scan --fail-on-high
      
      - name: Build Constructs
        run: lcc build --optimize
      
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
        run: lcc deploy --environment staging
      
      - name: Deploy to Production
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: lcc deploy --environment production --auto-rollback
```

#### Natural Language Pipeline Generation
```
User: "Create a GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Validates all constructs on PR
- Runs security scans
- Deploys to staging on develop branch
- Deploys to production on main with approval
- Includes rollback on failure"
```

### 2. GitLab CI Integration

```yaml
# .gitlab-ci.yml
stages:
  - validate
  - test
  - build
  - deploy

variables:
  LCC_VERSION: "latest"

before_script:
  - npm install -g @love-claude-code/cli@${LCC_VERSION}
  - lcc auth ${ANTHROPIC_API_KEY}

validate_constructs:
  stage: validate
  script:
    - lcc validate --strict
    - lcc lint --fix=false
  rules:
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_ID

test_constructs:
  stage: test
  script:
    - lcc test --parallel --coverage
    - lcc test:integration
  coverage: '/Coverage: \d+\.\d+%/'
  artifacts:
    reports:
      coverage_report:
        coverage_format: cobertura
        path: coverage/cobertura-coverage.xml

build_constructs:
  stage: build
  script:
    - lcc build --production
    - lcc bundle --optimize
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 week

deploy_staging:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - lcc deploy --env staging --strategy blue-green
  environment:
    name: staging
    url: https://staging.loveclaudecode.com
  only:
    - develop

deploy_production:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - lcc deploy --env production --strategy canary --rollout 10,50,100
  environment:
    name: production
    url: https://loveclaudecode.com
  when: manual
  only:
    - main
```

### 3. Jenkins Integration

```groovy
// Jenkinsfile
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    environment {
        LCC_API_KEY = credentials('anthropic-api-key')
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Setup') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install -g @love-claude-code/cli'
                sh 'lcc auth $LCC_API_KEY'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Validate Constructs') {
            steps {
                sh 'lcc validate --all'
                sh 'lcc dependency-check'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            parallel {
                stage('Unit Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'lcc test:unit'
                    }
                }
                stage('Integration Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'lcc test:integration'
                    }
                }
                stage('E2E Tests') {
                    steps {
                        sh 'lcc test:e2e --headless'
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage('Security Analysis') {
            steps {
                sh 'lcc security:scan --report=junit'
                sh 'lcc license:check --allowed=MIT,Apache-2.0'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                sh 'lcc build --target=production'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            when {
                branch 'main'
            }
            steps {
                sh 'lcc deploy --production --monitoring'
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        always {
            publishHTML([
                reportDir: 'coverage',
                reportFiles: 'index.html',
                reportName: 'Coverage Report'
            ])
            junit 'reports/**/*.xml'
        }
        failure {
            sh 'lcc rollback --auto'
        }
    }
}
```

## Advanced CI/CD Patterns

### 1. Self-Healing Pipelines

```
User: "Create a CI/CD pattern that:
- Monitors deployment health
- Auto-rolls back on errors
- Self-heals common issues
- Learns from failures"
```

Generated construct includes:
- Health check endpoints
- Automatic rollback triggers
- Self-healing scripts
- Failure pattern recognition

### 2. Multi-Environment Orchestration

```
User: "Build a deployment orchestrator that:
- Manages 5 environments (dev, test, staging, UAT, prod)
- Handles dependencies between services
- Coordinates database migrations
- Manages feature flags"
```

### 3. Construct-Aware Deployments

```typescript
// The platform understands construct dependencies
interface DeploymentStrategy {
  // Deploy L0 primitives first
  deployPrimitives(): Promise<void>
  
  // Then L1 components
  deployComponents(): Promise<void>
  
  // Then L2 patterns
  deployPatterns(): Promise<void>
  
  // Finally L3 applications
  deployApplications(): Promise<void>
}
```

## Container & Kubernetes Integration

### 1. Dockerfile Generation

```
User: "Generate a Dockerfile for my construct-based application 
with multi-stage build and security best practices"
```

Generated Dockerfile:
```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:20-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Construct build
COPY . .
RUN npm run lcc:build

# Security scan
FROM aquasec/trivy AS security
COPY --from=builder /app /app
RUN trivy fs /app

# Production stage  
FROM node:20-alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache dumb-init
USER node
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=builder --chown=node:node /app/node_modules ./node_modules
EXPOSE 3000
ENTRYPOINT ["dumb-init", "--"]
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]
```

### 2. Kubernetes Manifests

```
User: "Create Kubernetes manifests for my Love Claude Code application 
with auto-scaling, health checks, and gradual rollout"
```

Generated manifests include:
- Deployment with construct metadata
- Service with proper load balancing
- HPA for auto-scaling
- Network policies
- Secrets management

### 3. Helm Chart Generation

```
User: "Convert my constructs into a Helm chart with:
- Configurable values
- Environment-specific overrides  
- Dependency management
- Prometheus monitoring"
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### 1. Construct Metrics

```yaml
# Automatically generated metrics
construct_build_time_seconds
construct_test_coverage_percent
construct_dependency_count
construct_security_score
construct_deployment_status
```

### 2. Grafana Dashboard

```
User: "Create a Grafana dashboard for monitoring construct deployments"
```

Generated dashboard includes:
- Deployment frequency
- Success/failure rates
- Rollback statistics
- Performance metrics
- Security scan results

### 3. Alerting Rules

```
User: "Set up alerts for:
- Failed construct validations
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance degradation
- Deployment anomalies"
```

---

## Testing Strategies

### 1. Construct-Level Testing

```bash
# Test individual constructs
lcc test src/constructs/L1/Button

# Test construct integration
lcc test:integration --focus=authentication

# Test entire patterns
lcc test:pattern src/constructs/L2/UserManagement
```

### 2. Visual Regression Testing

```
User: "Add visual regression testing for all UI constructs"
```

Generates:
- Percy/Chromatic integration
- Baseline screenshots
- Diff detection
- Approval workflow

### 3. Performance Testing

```
User: "Create performance benchmarks for constructs with:
- Render time limits
- Bundle size budgets
- Memory usage thresholds"
```

---

## Security Integration

### 1. Supply Chain Security

```yaml
# SLSA Level 3 compliance
construct-validation:
  steps:
    - verify-signatures
    - check-provenance
    - scan-dependencies
    - validate-sources
```

### 2. Secret Management

```
User: "Integrate with HashiCorp Vault for:
- API key rotation
- Certificate management
- Dynamic secrets
- Audit logging"
```

### 3. Compliance Automation

```
User: "Ensure all constructs meet:
- OWASP Top 10 protection
- GDPR compliance
- SOC 2 requirements
- HIPAA standards"
```

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Construct Versioning

```bash
# Semantic versioning for constructs
lcc version:bump --construct=Button --type=minor
# Creates v1.2.0 â†’ v1.3.0
```

### 2. Dependency Management

```bash
# Check construct dependencies
lcc deps:check --update-lock

# Visualize dependency tree
lcc deps:graph --output=svg
```

### 3. Progressive Deployment

```bash
# Canary deployment
lcc deploy --strategy=canary --traffic=5,25,50,100

# Feature flag integration
lcc deploy --feature-flags=config/flags.json
```

### 4. Rollback Strategies

```bash
# Automatic rollback on metrics
lcc deploy --rollback-on="error_rate>5%"

# Manual rollback
lcc rollback --to-version=1.2.3
```

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Microservices CI/CD

```
User: "Create a CI/CD pipeline for 10 microservices built with constructs,
with shared libraries, coordinated deployments, and service mesh integration"
```

### Example 2: Mobile App Pipeline

```
User: "Build a pipeline that:
- Builds React Native constructs
- Runs device testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Construct Validation Failures**
   ```bash
   lcc validate --verbose --show-fixes
   ```

2. **Deployment Timeouts**
   ```bash
   lcc deploy --timeout=1800 --parallel=5
   ```

3. **Dependency Conflicts**
   ```bash
   lcc deps:resolve --strategy=newest
   ```

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Enable detailed logging
export LCC_DEBUG=true
lcc deploy --trace
```

---

## Migration from Traditional CI/CD

### Phase 1: Parallel Run
Run Love Claude Code validation alongside existing pipeline

### Phase 2: Gradual Integration
Replace individual stages with construct-aware equivalents

### Phase 3: Full Migration
Complete pipeline managed through constructs
