## Video Outline

### Opening (0:00-1:00)

**[VISUAL: Split screen - Complex Next.js codebase vs Clean construct architecture]**

**NARRATOR**: "If you're drowning in Next.js boilerplate, fighting with configurations, and spending more time on setup than features... this video is for you."

**[VISUAL: Love Claude Code logo animation]**

"Today, I'm migrating a real Next.js e-commerce app to Love Claude Code. We'll go from 15,000 lines of code to under 2,000 lines of natural language specifications. Let's dive in!"

---

## The Starting Point (1:00-3:00)

**[SCREEN: VS Code with Next.js project open]**

**NARRATOR**: "Here's our Next.js app - a typical e-commerce site with:"

```
📁 pages/
  📄 index.tsx         (500 lines)
  📄 products/[id].tsx (400 lines)
  📄 cart.tsx          (600 lines)
  📄 checkout.tsx      (800 lines)
  📄 api/auth/[...nextauth].ts
  📄 api/products/index.ts
  📄 api/orders/create.ts
📁 components/
  📄 ProductCard.tsx   (200 lines)
  📄 CartItem.tsx      (150 lines)
  📄 CheckoutForm.tsx  (400 lines)
  [... 40 more files]
📁 lib/
  📄 prisma.ts
  📄 stripe.ts
  📄 auth.ts
📄 next.config.js
📄 tailwind.config.js
[... more config files]
```

"15,000+ lines of code, 60+ files, countless hours of configuration. Sound familiar?"

---

## Step 1: Analyzing the Application (3:00-5:00)

**[SCREEN: Open Love Claude Code]**

**NARRATOR**: "First, let's have Love Claude Code analyze our Next.js app."

```
User: "Analyze this Next.js e-commerce application and suggest 
a construct-based architecture: [paste package.json and file structure]"
```

**[VISUAL: Claude's response showing construct breakdown]**

**Claude**: "I'll help you migrate this to a construct-based architecture:

**Identified Patterns:**
- Authentication flow → L2 Auth Pattern
- Product catalog → L2 E-commerce Pattern  
- Shopping cart → L1 Cart Component
- Checkout process → L2 Payment Pattern
- API routes → L1 API Constructs

**Suggested Architecture:**
- 4 L2 patterns (complete features)
- 12 L1 components (reusable parts)
- 8 L0 primitives (custom UI elements)"

---

## Step 2: Starting the Migration (5:00-8:00)

### Migrating the Product Catalog

**NARRATOR**: "Let's start with the product catalog. Here's the Next.js version:"

**[SCREEN: Show products/index.tsx with 500 lines of code]**

"Now watch this..."

```
User: "Create an e-commerce product catalog pattern with:
- Grid and list view toggle
- Sorting by price, name, date
- Filtering by category and price range  
- Pagination with 20 items per page
- Search functionality
- Loading and error states
- Responsive design
- SEO optimization"
```

**[VISUAL: Show Claude generating the complete pattern]**

"In 30 seconds, we've replaced 500 lines of code with a reusable pattern that includes tests, documentation, and better features than our original."

---

## Step 3: Authentication Migration (8:00-10:00)

**[SCREEN: Show NextAuth configuration]**

**NARRATOR**: "Next.js authentication with NextAuth requires multiple files and configurations. Let's simplify:"

```
User: "Create an authentication pattern that supports:
- Email/password login
- Google and GitHub OAuth
- JWT tokens with refresh
- Protected routes
- User profile management
- Password reset flow
- Remember me functionality"
```

**[VISUAL: Side-by-side comparison]**

**Before**: 
- 5 files
- 300+ lines of code
- Complex configuration
- Manual session handling

**After**:
- 1 L2 Auth Pattern
- Natural language config
- Built-in security
- Automatic everything

---

## Step 4: The Shopping Cart (10:00-12:00)

**NARRATOR**: "The shopping cart is often the most complex part. Our Next.js version uses Redux, local storage, and complex state management."

**[SCREEN: Show Redux store and cart components]**

```
User: "Create a shopping cart construct with:
- Add/remove items
- Quantity adjustment
- Price calculation with tax
- Discount code support
- Persistent storage
- Real-time sync across tabs
- Stock validation
- Guest and user cart merge"
```

**[VISUAL: Live demo of generated cart]**

"Notice how the construct handles edge cases our original code missed - like merging guest and user carts!"

---

## Step 5: Database and API Migration (12:00-14:00)

**NARRATOR**: "Now for the backend. Our Next.js app uses Prisma with PostgreSQL."

```
User: "Convert this Prisma schema to Love Claude Code constructs:

model Product {
  id          String   @id @default(cuid())
  name        String
  price       Decimal
  description String?
  images      String[]
  category    Category @relation(fields: [categoryId], references: [id])
  categoryId  String
  stock       Int
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}

Include CRUD operations, validation, and search capabilities"
```

**[VISUAL: Show generated database constructs with built-in API]**

"Love Claude Code automatically creates type-safe APIs, validations, and even GraphQL endpoints if needed."

---

## Step 6: Deployment Comparison (14:00-16:00)

### Next.js Deployment

**[SCREEN: Show Vercel deployment config]**

**NARRATOR**: "Deploying Next.js typically involves:"
- Environment variables
- Build configurations
- Database migrations
- CDN setup
- Monitoring integration

### Love Claude Code Deployment

```
User: "Deploy this e-commerce platform to production with:
- Auto-scaling
- CDN for images
- Database backups
- Monitoring and alerts
- A/B testing capability"
```

**[VISUAL: One-click deployment happening]**

"That's it. One command, everything configured."

## The Results (16:00-18:00)

**[VISUAL: Before/After statistics dashboard]**

### Metrics Comparison

| Metric | Next.js | Love Claude Code | Improvement |
|--------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Lines of Code | 15,000 | 1,800 | 88% reduction |
| Files | 60+ | 12 | 80% reduction |
| Build Time | 3 min | 30 sec | 6x faster |
| Bundle Size | 2.4 MB | 800 KB | 66% smaller |
| Dev Setup Time | 2 hours | 5 minutes | 24x faster |
| Time to Add Feature | 2 days | 2 hours | 8x faster |

### Performance Improvements
- **First Paint**: 1.2s → 0.4s
- **Time to Interactive**: 3.5s → 1.1s
- **Lighthouse Score**: 76 → 98

## Migration Tips & Tricks (18:00-19:00)

### 1. Incremental Migration
"You don't have to migrate everything at once:"

```
User: "Create a construct wrapper for my existing Next.js pages
so I can migrate incrementally"
```

### 2. Preserve Business Logic
```
User: "Extract and preserve this complex pricing algorithm
while migrating to constructs: [paste code]"
```

### 3. Maintain URLs
```
User: "Ensure all existing URLs continue working after migration
with proper 301 redirects"
```

### 4. Data Migration
```
User: "Create a migration script to move data from Prisma 
PostgreSQL to the new construct-based system"
```
