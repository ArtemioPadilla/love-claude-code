   - Integration testing
   - Documentation review
   - Demo preparation
   ```

3. **Sprint Review (1 hour)**
   ```
   - Feature demonstration
   - Metrics review
   - Retrospective
   - Next sprint planning
   ```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Starting an Agent Session

```markdown
You are the [AGENT_TYPE] Agent for Love Claude Code Platform.

Your focus areas:
- [Primary responsibility]
- [Secondary responsibility]
- [Integration points]

Current sprint goal: [SPECIFIC_GOAL]

Dependencies:
- Input from: [OTHER_AGENTS]
- Output to: [OTHER_AGENTS]

Please work on: [SPECIFIC_TASK]
```

### Agent Handoff Protocol

When an agent completes a task:

1. **Update Status**
   ```markdown
   Task: [TASK_NAME]
   Status: COMPLETED
   Output: [FILE_PATHS]
   Tests: [TEST_PATHS]
   Docs: [DOC_PATHS]
   Next: [DEPENDENT_TASKS]
   ```

2. **Integration Checklist**
   - [ ] Code follows project standards
   - [ ] Tests pass with >95% coverage
   - [ ] Documentation updated
   - [ ] No breaking changes
   - [ ] Performance benchmarks met

3. **Handoff Message**
   ```markdown
   @NextAgent: [TASK_NAME] complete
   - Input available at: [PATH]
   - API changes: [YES/NO]
   - Breaking changes: [YES/NO]
   - Action needed: [SPECIFIC_ACTION]
   ```

## Best Practices

### Do's
- ✅ Small, focused commits
- ✅ Descriptive PR titles
- ✅ Update tests with code
- ✅ Document while coding
- ✅ Communicate blockers early

### Don'ts
- ❌ Large, monolithic PRs
- ❌ Skip tests "temporarily"
- ❌ Break existing APIs
- ❌ Ignore performance
- ❌ Work in isolation

## Tools and Resources

### Communication
- GitHub Issues: Task tracking
- PR Comments: Code review
- Slack/Discord: Real-time chat
- Video calls: Complex discussions

### Development
- VS Code: Shared settings
- ESLint: Code standards
- Jest/Vitest: Testing
- Storybook: Component docs

### Monitoring
- GitHub Actions: CI/CD

## Scaling Guidelines

### Adding New Agents
1. Define clear responsibility area
2. Identify dependencies
3. Create onboarding checklist
4. Assign mentor agent
5. Start with small tasks

### Splitting Agent Work
When an agent is overloaded:
1. Identify divisible tasks
2. Create sub-specialization
3. Define new interfaces
4. Handoff gradually

### Merging Agent Roles
When agents have low utilization:
1. Identify overlap areas
2. Combine related skills
3. Maintain specialization
4. Update documentation

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Bug
1. Stop feature work
2. Assign to Security/Performance agent
3. Create hotfix branch
4. Fast-track review process
5. Deploy immediately

### Integration Failure
1. Rollback to last known good
2. Identify breaking change
3. Fix or revert
4. Add regression test
5. Document root cause

### Agent Unavailability
1. Reassign critical tasks
2. Document handoff
3. Prioritize blockers
4. Adjust sprint goals
5. Update timeline
