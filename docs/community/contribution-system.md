# Love Claude Code Community Contribution System

## Building the Future Together

The Love Claude Code community is at the heart of our platform's evolution. This guide outlines how developers, designers, educators, and innovators can contribute to the platform that builds itself.

## Contribution Philosophy

### Open Source, Open Future
- **Collaborative Development**: The platform grows through community contributions
- **Shared Ownership**: Contributors become stakeholders in the platform's success
- **Inclusive Innovation**: All skill levels welcome, from beginners to experts
- **Recognition & Rewards**: Contributions are valued and rewarded

### The Compound Community Effect
Just as constructs build on each other, community contributions compound:
- Each contribution makes the next one easier
- Shared constructs accelerate everyone's development
- Collective intelligence improves the platform
- Success stories inspire more contributions

## Contribution Process

### Step 1: Setup Environment
```bash
# Fork the repository
git clone https://github.com/love-claude-code/love-claude-code
cd love-claude-code

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development environment
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test
```

### Step 2: Choose Contribution Type

#### For Construct Development:
```bash
# Generate new construct scaffold
npm run construct:create

# Follow prompts:
# - Construct level (L0/L1/L2/L3)
# - Construct type (ui/infrastructure/pattern)
# - Name and description
```

#### For Documentation:
```bash
# Create new documentation
npm run docs:create

# Categories:
# - tutorials/
# - guides/
# - references/
# - examples/
```

### Step 3: Develop with AI Assistance
```
User: "Help me create a construct for [your idea]"

Claude: "I'll help you build that construct. Let's start with:
1. Defining the specification
2. Creating test cases
3. Implementing the construct
4. Adding documentation"
```

### Step 4: Test Thoroughly
```bash
# Run construct tests
npm run test:construct [construct-name]

# Run integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Check construct guidelines
npm run construct:validate
```

### Step 5: Submit Contribution
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/my-construct

# Commit with conventional commits
git commit -m "feat(L1): add DataVisualization construct"

# Push and create PR
git push origin feat/my-construct
```

/**
 * DataVisualization renders charts and graphs
 * @param props - Configuration for the visualization
 * @returns React component
 */
export const DataVisualization: React.FC<ConstructProps> = (props) => {
  // Implementation
}
```
