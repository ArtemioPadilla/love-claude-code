## Technical Integration Guide

### Step 1: Create Your Base Construct

```typescript
// partners/stripe/L1/StripeProvider.ts
import { L1ExternalConstruct } from '@/constructs/base/L1ExternalConstruct'

export class StripeProvider extends L1ExternalConstruct {
  constructor(config: StripeConfig) {
    super({
      name: 'StripeProvider',
      version: '1.0.0',
      category: 'payment',
      external: {
        service: 'Stripe',
        sdkVersion: '^11.0.0',
        documentation: 'https://stripe.com/docs'
      }
    })
  }
  
  async initialize() {
    // Validate API keys
    // Set up webhooks
    // Configure security
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Build UI Constructs

```typescript
// partners/stripe/L1/StripeCheckout.tsx
export const StripeCheckout: L1Component = {
  name: 'StripeCheckout',
  category: 'payment-ui',
  dependencies: ['StripeProvider'],
  
  render: (props: CheckoutProps) => {
    // Secure, accessible checkout UI
    // Automatic error handling
    // Loading states
    // Success/failure callbacks
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Create Integration Patterns

```typescript
// partners/stripe/L2/SubscriptionPattern.ts
export const StripeSubscriptionPattern: L2Pattern = {
  name: 'StripeSubscriptionManagement',
  constructs: [
    'StripeProvider',
    'StripeCheckout',
    'StripeCustomerPortal',
    'StripeWebhookHandler'
  ],
  
  compose: () => {
    // Complete subscription system
    // Automatic trial handling
    // Upgrade/downgrade flows
    // Cancellation workflows
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Enable Natural Language

```typescript
// partners/stripe/ai/natural-language.ts
export const stripeNLPHandler = {
  intents: [
    {
      pattern: /create.*payment.*form/i,
      handler: async (params) => {
        return generateStripeCheckout(params)
      }
    },
    {
      pattern: /set.*up.*subscription/i,
      handler: async (params) => {
        return generateSubscriptionSystem(params)
      }
    }
  ],
  
  documentation: {
    examples: [
      "Create a payment form for one-time purchases",
      "Set up subscription billing with free trial",
      "Add Apple Pay and Google Pay support"
    ]
  }
}
```
