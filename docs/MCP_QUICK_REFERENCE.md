# MCP Quick Reference Guide

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables Claude Code to understand and assist with backend provider selection and management in Love Claude Code.

## Quick Start Examples

### 1. Choosing a Provider for Your Project

```
You: "I'm building a social media app for 50k users"
Claude: Let me analyze your requirements...

Based on your needs:
- Firebase is recommended (score: 0.87)
- Real-time features ‚úì
- Social auth ‚úì  
- Auto-scaling ‚úì
- Estimated cost: $45/month
```

### 2. Comparing Costs

```
You: "Compare costs between Firebase and AWS for my app"
Claude: Here's the cost breakdown:

Firebase:
- Monthly: $45
- Yearly: $540
- Includes CDN and real-time

AWS:
- Monthly: $75
- Yearly: $900
- More control but higher complexity
```

### 3. Planning a Migration

```
You: "Help me migrate from local to Firebase"
Claude: I'll create a migration plan:

Steps:
1. Export users (5 min)
2. Convert database (15 min)
3. Upload files (10 min)
4. Update config (5 min)

Total time: ~35 minutes
Risk: Low
```

## Cost Guidelines

### User-based Estimates

**1-1,000 users:**

- Firebase: $25-200
- AWS: $50-500

**100,000+ users:**
- Local: Not recommended
- Firebase: $200+
- AWS: $500+ (but more efficient at scale)

## Migration Timelines

### Local ‚Üí Firebase
- Small app (< 1k users): 30 minutes
- Medium app (1k-10k users): 2-4 hours
- Large app (10k+ users): 1-2 days

### Firebase ‚Üí AWS
- Small app: 2-4 hours
- Medium app: 1-2 days
