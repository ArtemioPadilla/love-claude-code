### 🤖 MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

Love Claude Code includes a powerful MCP server that enables Claude to understand your infrastructure needs and help you make informed decisions about backend providers.

**What can Claude help with?**
- 🔍 **Analyze Requirements**: Understand your project needs and constraints
- 📊 **Compare Providers**: See detailed comparisons of Local, Firebase, and AWS
- 💰 **Estimate Costs**: Get accurate cost projections based on usage
- 🔄 **Plan Migrations**: Create step-by-step migration plans between providers
- 🏥 **Monitor Health**: Check provider status and performance
- ⚙️ **Manage Config**: Handle provider settings through conversation

**Example Claude Interactions:**
```
You: "I need a backend for my e-commerce app with 100k users"
Claude: *analyzes requirements and recommends Firebase for rapid development*

You: "How much would it cost to run this on AWS vs Firebase?"
Claude: *provides detailed cost breakdown for both providers*

You: "Help me migrate from local development to Firebase"
Claude: *creates migration plan with estimated timeline*
```
