# Next Steps for Love Claude Code

## 🚀 Immediate Actions (This Week)

### 1. Get the Backend Running
```bash
# Start the backend server
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Or use Docker
docker-compose up backend
```

**Why**: The frontend is trying to connect to the backend API. Without it, file operations and project management won't work.

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example files
cp .env.example .env.local
cp .env.docker.example .env.docker

# Add your API keys
# - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY for Claude
# - Provider credentials if using Firebase/AWS
```

- [ ] Handle backend connection errors gracefully
- [ ] Add loading states to prevent UI flashing
- [ ] Fix TypeScript compilation warnings
- [ ] Implement error boundaries for better UX
