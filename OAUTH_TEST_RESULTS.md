# OAuth Implementation Test Results

## What We've Implemented

### 1. OpenCode Approach
- Added `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20` header to OAuth requests
- Removed x-api-key header when using OAuth
- Modified the Anthropic client to use OAuth tokens with special headers

### 2. Custom OAuth Client Fallback
- Created `claudeCodeOAuth.ts` that bypasses the Anthropic SDK
- Uses direct fetch requests with OAuth headers
- Implements both regular and streaming message endpoints
- Automatically tries this approach if the SDK fails with "Claude Code only" error

### 3. Claude Code CLI Wrapper
- Created `claudeCodeCLI.ts` that wraps the Claude Code CLI tool
- Executes Claude Code commands in headless mode
- Supports both regular and streaming responses
- Automatically tries this approach if other OAuth methods fail
- Checks if Claude Code CLI is installed before attempting

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Detects the specific "This credential is only authorized for use with Claude Code" error
- Automatically falls back through multiple approaches: OpenCode → OAuth Client → CLI Wrapper
- Provides clear error messages for different failure scenarios

## How to Test

1. **Restart the backend** to apply the changes:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **(Optional) Install Claude Code CLI** for the third fallback option:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

3. **Try sending a message** in the chat
   - The console will show authentication attempts
   - Watch for "trying OpenCode approach with beta header"
   - If that fails, it will try "Claude Code OAuth client approach"
   - If that also fails, it will try "Claude Code CLI approach" (if installed)

4. **Check the console logs** for:
   - Authentication method being used
   - Success or failure of each approach
   - Specific error messages if it fails

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Scenario
If the OpenCode approach works:
- You'll get real Claude responses
- No more mock responses
- OAuth will work just like API keys

### Fallback Scenario
If the OpenCode approach fails but the custom client works:
- First attempt will fail with "Claude Code only" error
- Automatic fallback to custom OAuth client
- Should still get real responses

### Failure Scenario
If both approaches fail:
- You'll see specific error messages
- May need to implement Claude Code CLI wrapper (next step)
- For now, use API keys as a workaround

## What's Next

If the current implementation doesn't work:

1. **Claude Code CLI Wrapper** (✅ IMPLEMENTED)
   - Install Claude Code CLI: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
   - The system will automatically detect and use it if available
   - Execute commands and parse output
   - More likely to work but requires CLI installation

2. **Claude Code SDK Integration** (Task #3)
   - Use the official Claude Code SDK
   - Different from Anthropic SDK
   - Designed for OAuth tokens

3. **Investigate Token Format**
   - The OAuth token might need special formatting
   - Check if there's a token exchange endpoint
   - Look for undocumented APIs

## Debug Information

When testing, look for these console messages:
- "OAuth token detected - trying OpenCode approach with beta header"
- "Claude Code OAuth request:" (shows request details)
- "Claude Code restriction detected - trying alternative OAuth approach"
- "Attempting Claude Code OAuth client approach..."
- "Alternative OAuth approach also failed" (if OAuth client fails)
- "Attempting Claude Code CLI approach..."
- "Claude Code CLI is installed, using CLI wrapper" (if CLI is available)
- "Claude Code CLI is not installed" (if CLI is not available)

The system will tell you exactly which approach is being tried and why it failed.
